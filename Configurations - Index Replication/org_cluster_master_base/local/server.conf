# The master's clustering configuration sets the default values for
# replication factor and search factor. The replication factor setting here
# couples with the 'repFactor = auto' setting on an index. When the index's
# repFactor is auto (rather than a number), the default replication_factor set
# by the master sets the number of replicated copies for that index.

# The pass4SymmKey used for indexer clustering (above) permits hosts to 
# add themselves to the indexing cluster. A malicious user could add their
# own host as a search head to an existing cluster, thereby able to *define
# their own level of access*, circumventing any controls that may be in 
# place on the "regular" search heads. For this reason, it is strongly
# suggested to provide a *separate* pass4SymmKey for the indexer discovery
# function when it is used (uncomment both lines and set the value).

# Optionally set this for a nice label within the (D)MC management screens
# as a label for referring to the cluster. (6.3+)

# You can configure the master so that the cluster does replicate summaries.
# All searchable bucket copies will then have associated summaries.
# This is the recommended behavior for all clusters not using SmartStore.
# With SmartStore summary replication is unnecessary, and is therefore 
# unsupported, because the uploaded summary is available to all peer nodes.
